    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This dish features noodles (any kind) and small bites of tender chicken breast drenched in a creamy sauce that’s inspired by Thai peanut sauce. The sauce is a rich mix of creamy coconut milk, savory peanut butter, spicy sriracha sauce, fresh garlic and ginger, a little soy sauce and brown sugar, and a splash of lime juice to keep everything bright. This easy sauce is absolutely divine and you’re going to want to spoon it over everything!
    <h3>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1/3 cup smooth natural-style peanut butter</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp sriracha</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 fresh lime (2 Tbsp juice)</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 tsp grated fresh ginger</li>
      <li>1 13.5oz. can coconut milk</li>
      <li>1 boneless, skinless chicken breast (about ⅔ lb.)</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp cooking oil</li>
      <li>8 oz. noodles*</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chopped peanuts</li>
      <li>1/4 cup chopped cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Prepare the peanut sauce first. In a medium bowl, whisk together the peanut butter, sriracha, brown sugar, soy sauce, 2 Tbsp lime juice, minced garlic, and grated ginger.</li>
      <li>Add the coconut milk to the peanut sauce and whisk until smooth again.</li>
      <li>Cut the chicken breast into small ½ to 1-inch sized pieces.</li>
      <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high. Once hot, add the cooking oil and swirl to coat the surface of the skillet. Add the chicken and cook until browned on all sides. Be careful not to overcook the chicken.</li>
      <li>Add the prepared peanut sauce into the skillet, turn the heat down to medium-low, and stir to dissolve any browned bits off the bottom of the skillet. Let the chicken simmer in the sauce over low, stirring occasionally, while you cook the noodles.</li>
      <li>Cook your noodles according to the package directions, then drain in a colander.</li>
      <li>Add the cooked and drained noodles to the skillet with the peanut sauce and chicken. Toss until everything is evenly mixed and coated in sauce.</li>
      <li>Top the noodles with chopped peanuts and cilantro, then enjoy!</li>
